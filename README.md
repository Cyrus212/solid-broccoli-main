# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description
I built this project to get experience working with the Apollo Server and Apollo Client libraries to implement a GraphQL architecture. The app replaces a REST API with a GraphQL API for efficient data fetching.

This project gave me hands-on experience building and consuming a GraphQL API with Node.js and React. I learned how to:

Define a GraphQL schema and resolvers
Set up an Apollo Server to serve the GraphQL API
Make queries and mutations from React components using Apollo Client
Manage loading and error UI states
